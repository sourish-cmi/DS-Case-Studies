# Bayesian Analysis with Horse Shoe Prior using CRRao.jl

## By Sourish Das

### Chennai Mathematical Institute

## **Abstract**

CRRao.jl is built as a single API for diverse statistical models. Drawing inspiration from the Zelig package in the R world, the CRRao package provides a simple and consistent API for end-users. In this talk, we will present how to implement Bayesian Analysis with the Horse-Shoe Prior using CRRao.jl. We will demonstrate how the Poisson regression model can be implemented for the English Premier League dataset, using Ridge prior, Laplace prior, Cauchy prior, and Horse-Shoe prior. Furthermore, we will show how Logistic Regression with the Horse-Shoe prior can be implemented using the Friedrich Ataxia dataset from Genome research. Additionally, we will illustrate how Gaussian Process Regression can be implemented using the CRRao API call.
