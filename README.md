# Data Science Case Studies

Case Studies are extremely important for the teaching, learning and telling stories of Data Science. This repo would be the one-stop place for different data science case studies. The problem statement, dataset, source code, report and analysis will be available here; primarily focusing on **reproducibility**, **replicability**, and **readability**. The aim will always be on scientifically rigorous studies in the multidisciplinary field. The repo provides a crossroads at which foundational data science work intersects directly with critical applications from industry, governments, and other sciences. By disseminating inspiring reproducible case studies, DSCS aspires to be an interdisciplinary forum on data science for all.
