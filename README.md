# Data Science Case Studies

Case Studies are extremely important for the teaching, learning and telling stories of Data Science. This repo would be one stop place for different case studies of data science, where the probalem statement, dataset, source code, report and analysis, every thing could be find in one place with primary focus on **reproducibility**, **replicability**, and **readability**. The aim will be always on scientifically rigorous studies on multidisciplinary field. The repo provides a crossroads at which foundational data science work intersect directly with important applications from industry, governments, and other sciences. By disseminating inspiring reproducible case studies DSCS aspires to be an interdisciplinary forum on data science for all.
